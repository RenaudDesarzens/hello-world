# hello-world
My first repository to learn GitHub

Goal is to develop some addons or modules for Odoo v12 community edition.

But 1st I have to learn python programming and how the development workflow is.
For this I'm reading some Odoo Development Essentials on PackPub, learning python beside this and right now doing my 1st steps in GitHub.

I'm using Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS.
